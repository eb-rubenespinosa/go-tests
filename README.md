### Linux

To download the latest Linux build, run:

```bash
$ curl -Lo yak.tar.gz -H "Authorization: token TOKEN" -H "Accept: application/octet-stream" https://api.github.com/repos/eb-rubenespinosa/go-tests/releases/assets/18095300 && sudo mv yak /usr/local/bin`
```

Note: Yak has been not tested on linux and so may not support linux as expected.
