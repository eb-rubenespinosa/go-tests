### Linux

To download the latest Linux build, run:

```bash
$ curl -Lo yak.tar.gz https://github.com/eb-rubenespinosa/go-tests/releases/download/1.1.15/yak-linux-amd64-1.1.15.tar.gz && sudo mv yak /usr/local/bin`
```

Note: Yak has been not tested on linux and so may not support linux as expected.
