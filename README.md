### Linux

To download the latest Linux build, run:

```bash
$ curl -Lo yak.tar.gz https://jenkins.evbhome.com/job/yak-release/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/src/github.com/eventbrite/yak/yak-linux-amd64-0.1.4.tar.gz && sudo mv yak /usr/local/bin`
```

Note: Yak has been not tested on linux and so may not support linux as expected.
